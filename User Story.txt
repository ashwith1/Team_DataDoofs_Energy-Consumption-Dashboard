Title: Impact of Geopolitical Events on EU Energy Consumption

As a: Policy Analyst at an EU energy regulatory agency,

I want to: Understand how significant geopolitical events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have impacted the consumption patterns of electricity and gas in the EU,

So that I can: Develop informed policies to ensure energy security and sustainable consumption practices in future crises.

Business Questions

2) What was the trend in natural gas consumption in the EU during the Russia-Ukraine war?
3) Which EU countries experienced the highest change in electricity consumption during these geopolitical events?
4) How did the consumption of gas fluctuate during the pandemic versus during the Russia-Ukraine conflict?
5)Were there specific months or seasons where the impact on energy consumption was more pronounced?(cooling and heating days)
6) How do energy imports and exports balance with EU's overall energy consumption and production affected post
